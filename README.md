====================
Author: Jay W Johnson

Purpose:
Have a faster way to sift through images. Quickly see full image and zoom 100% for blurriness. Options to delete NEF/JPG, convert NEF to JPG

Future additions:
HDR editing of multiple rectified images.
3D point clouds from multiple images.


TODO:
    GOALS:
        -Use OpenCV's feature matching to line up multiple similar images so that specific locations can be compared in detail.
            -Image ranking uses the EXIF five star system.
        -Apply HDR algorithm to lined up images and produce a new image.
        -Apply SFM algorithm to multiple images and produce a point cloud.
    ADDITIONAL:
        -Add easy tagging feature
